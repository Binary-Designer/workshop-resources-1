# CAD Workshop

CAD software is an integral part of the design process in most engineering disciplines, and will prove to be a very useful tool when completing ENGG1100, METR2800 and further courses. In this workshop, we will provide an introduction to CAD and teach the fundamentals of 3D modelling in Siemens NX. You don't need to have any prior knowledge coming into this workshop, as it is aimed towards students who are completely new to the process. By the end you should be familiar with the user interface of Siemens NX and be able to create simple parts and assemblies.

This workshop was developed in collaboration with [MESS](https://www.facebook.com/messuq/). 

## Workshop Preparation
Before coming into the workshop, you should:
1. Download and Install Siemens NX. See the installation instructions [here](Installation Guide.pdf). If you cannot do this, you can also connect to UQ computers via a [remote desktop](https://student.eait.uq.edu.au/infrastructure/remote-access/rdp.html). All EAIT computers will have Siemens NX preinstalled, but there are a limited number of computers available so during the workshop you are not guaranteed to get one.
2. Download and save [these](assets) files (ideally)

## Workshop
Here are the details of our next CAD workshop:
    Date: March 7, 2023
    Time: 6:00pm - 8:00pm
    Location: 46-242/243

Using a mouse is essential when using CAD software, so make sure to bring one! The workshop will also be fully catered.
## Post-Workshop Resources
1. After the workshop, if you want you can refer to the source files of the project [here](Phone Project). Our slide deck will also be added to this folder.
2. Look out for more information on future workshops. We also aim to produce more resources in the future to keep growing your CAD skills. Stay tuned on this page for any updates.
3. If you need any assistance when it comes to CAD, you can join the UQ MARS discord [here](https://discord.gg/AaGMcpNT). We will be more than happy to help out!
